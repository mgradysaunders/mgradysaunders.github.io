# Introduction

I'm Grady, a second-year PhD student at the [Chester F. Carlson 
Center for Imaging Science][1] at the [Rochester Institute of 
Technology][2]. My primary interests are computer graphics and scientific
computing. I spend a fair amount of time programming in C/C++, Python, and
Ruby. Accordingly, this is the master homepage for my [GitHub account][3],
where I manage open-source repositories for my current projects.
