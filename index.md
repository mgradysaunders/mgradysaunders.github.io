# Introduction

<img width="100px" height="100px" src="/assets/images/profile.png">

I'm Grady, a second-year PhD student at the [Chester F. Carlson 
Center for Imaging Science][1] at the [Rochester Institute of 
Technology][2]. My primary interests are computer graphics and scientific
computing. I spend a fair amount of time programming in C/C++, Python, and
Ruby. Accordingly, this is the master homepage for my [GitHub account][3],
where I manage open-source repositories for my current projects.

### Projects

As part of my graduate research, I'm developing [Labyrinth][4], a C++14 
codebase for time-parametric modeling of maize canopy geometry and spectral
features for eventual integration with [DIRSIG5][5], the
_Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation_ software developed
by Scott Brown and Adam Goodenough.

In my free time, I'm actively developing two type-generic, header-only 
C++17/C++20 projects:
- [Platinum][6], a dense numerical linear algebra package, and
- [Erffamily][7], a modern interface to the complex error function
and its relatives.
